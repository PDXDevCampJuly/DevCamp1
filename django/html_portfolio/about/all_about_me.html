    <quoteblock> So few times in life do we risk getting burned that we miss the opportunity of having our soul set fire to burn freely and
    wildly with such intensity and brightness that in comparison pales the sun! </quoteblock>

      <h3> ~It's all about the passion~ </h3>
        <p>
          Hello and Good Day!

          I'm professional, courteous, caring, and fun-loving.  I'm highly motivated to ensure the highest possible customer
          service to customers as well as co-workers. I am an adventuresome, passionate soul who has the ability to wear many different hats. I love being able jump right
          in to learn by doing and am results/solutions driven.
          As I am constantly learning and challenging myself to grow beyond my comfort zone,
          my career aspirations are such that in an industry I'm able to use my creativity, analytical skills,
          and my compassion to truly do business the right way with integrity and honesty; where it really can be a win-win situation.

          I am above all - true to myself and full of passion!
        </p>

            <p>
              Interests ebb and flow, yet there is always a constant in everything I do.
              All of these interests involve connection to everything around me.
              I don't want to just look at it. I want to connect to it.
              Don't just dance with me. Connect with me.
            </p>
