        <h2> Solo Dancing </h2>

      Theatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle,
      usually a performance upon a stage by virtuoso dancers. It often tells a story, perhaps using mime, costume and scenery,
      or else it may simply interpret the musical accompaniment, which is often specially composed. Examples are western ballet and modern dance,
      Classical Indian dance and Chinese and Japanese song and dance dramas. Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone,
      but performance dance may also appear in opera and other forms of musical theatre.

      <h2> Social Dancing </h2>

      Participatory dance, on the other hand, whether it be a folk dance, a social dance, a group dance such as a line,
       circle, chain or square dance, or a partner dance such as is common in western Western ballroom dancing, is undertaken primarily for a
       common purpose, such as social interaction or exercise, of participants rather than onlookers. Such dance seldom has any narrative.
       A group dance and a corps de ballet, a social partner dance and a pas de deux, differ profoundly.
       Even a solo dance may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. Participatory dancers often all employ the same
       movements and steps but, for example, in the rave culture of electronic dance music, vast crowds may engage in free dance, uncoordinated with
       those around them. On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women
       and children may or must participate.

     <h2> Dance doesn't lead to sex.  </h2>
       <p>
         I firmly believe sex, sexiness, and intimacy are not synonomous.
         A dance with someone can be intimate, sexy, and hot as Texas, but that doesn't mean that it leads to sex.
