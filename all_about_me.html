      My name is Summer!

      I'm professional, courteous, caring, and fun-loving.  I'm highly motivated to ensure the highest possible customer
      service to customers as well as co-workers. I am an adventuresome, passionate soul who has the ability to wear many different hats. I love being able jump right
      in to learn by doing and am results/solutions driven.
      As I am constantly learning and challenging myself to grow beyond my comfort zone,
      my career aspirations are such that in an industry I'm able to use my creativity, analytical skills,
      and my compassion to truly do business the right way with integrity and honesty; where it really can be a win-win situation.

      I am above all - true to myself and full of passion!
