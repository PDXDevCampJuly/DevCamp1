Summer,

I can’t find any holes in your code, your programs are about as efficient as they need to be. Your variables are well-named. I like your CSS name, forumrockstarstyle.css. I can see how it would be easy to swap out with a ‘forumhollywoodstyle' or a ‘forumhiphopstyle'! There are a few cosmetic changes you could make so it looks cleaner but I wasn't confused when I was reading it.

<HTML>

Your HTML is short and sweet. You seem to have a good grasp of HTML5. When I’m reading HTML, I like to visualize the DOM tree in my head, so I’ve started putting spaces after siblings, but not children (except in the head). It does make my code a little longer but as a beginner, I find it helps break up chunks of text so it’s a little more legible. Consistent indents would be helpful too, i.e, the link, main & script tags. 

L2 - I believe the convention is to put the title inside the head tag. I know if you have a DOCTYPE, title and form tag in a row, IE will do weird things with your DOM tree. But your code would be fine. 

.CSS
 
Your CSS looks good, I didn’t see any redundancy. Removing the blank lines would make it look cleaner. 

L15 & L34 - it’s a good idea to put semicolons after the last CSS declaration, in case another developer adds some to your stylesheet but doesn’t notice the last semicolon is missing. 

JAVASCRIPT;

You could make this shorter by eliminating the console logs and the old functions you commented out, but other than that it looks good. 

L26 - I like your onload function to check the status of your request. Nice. 

L51 - could use an indent.

All in all, very solid work! Keep it up:)
